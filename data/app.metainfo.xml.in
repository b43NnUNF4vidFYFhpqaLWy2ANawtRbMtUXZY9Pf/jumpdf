    <p>
      A common frustration when reading is the need to manually scroll back and forth between distant locations and references. With jumpdf, one can instead mark locations and jump between them. Unlike marks in similar PDF viewers like sioyek and zathura, however, marks in jumpdf move with the viewer instead of being a static record of some location, thus avoiding the need to manually reset them. In addition, marks are organized into groups, which can be switched between. Besides serving as an organizational tool to help with differentiating sets of related marks, groups can also be opened in separate windows.
